# GeneTypes
GeneTypes R package for gene objects which represent different gene types. 

Based on a set of S4 classes for different gene types which are inherited from a virtual gene class that represents genes in general.
Each gene should contain information about itâ€™s ID, HUGO symbol, gene name, description, gene structure (chromosome, start, end, strand, exons, and gene product(s).
It has a class-specific function "lengthProduct(gene)" which returns the length of the product of a specific gene object.
